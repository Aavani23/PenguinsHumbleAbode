            <p class="GenI">
             African penguins, also known as jackass penguins due to their distinctive braying call, are a species
             of penguin native to the coastlines of southern Africa. These charming birds are adapted to a warm climate, making their colonies 
             unique among penguin species. Recognizable by the black band and spots on their chest, African penguins are excellent swimmers, capable of reaching speeds of 
             up to 15 miles per hour underwater as they hunt for fish. Sadly, they are currently listed as endangered due to threats like oil spills, overfishing, and habitat 
             destruction. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these fascinating creatures and their coastal habitats.
